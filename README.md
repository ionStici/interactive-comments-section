# Interactive comments section solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the Project

This project simulates a social media-like comments section where users can engage by posting comments, replying to existing ones, deleting comments with a confirmation popup, and upvoting or downvoting comments for a dynamic user interaction experience.

**Fact:** Since this project was built when I was learning React, it's basically not a "how react should be used" project, but still it seems to work.
